## Documentation notes

This documentation is built using Hugo *Extended* version. This repo stores the source for the documentation in
`/docs/hugo` and the Hugo compiled documentation in `/docs/dist`. The script to initiate the compilation is
`/docs/build.sh`

Please note that, for the time being, the documentation will generally be behind compared to the actual features and
updates in the master branch. 

Some of the documentation in the Hugo rendered site comes directly from the "read me" markdown files in the project and
are copied in as Hugo content with the build script.

The `ace-documentation` Hugo theme was altered because it has issues with the version of Hugo I am using.
Don't download again over the existing directory.
