<h1>Intro</h1>

<h2 id="inspiration-for-this-project">Inspiration for this project</h2>
<h4 id="what-are-the-challenged-with-qweb">What are the challenged with QWeb?</h4>
<p><strong>Using Qweb to develop your UX solution has some specific drawbacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>QWeb is still based on terse and bloated XML</li>
<li>QWeb is complicated and has a big learning curve</li>
<li>QWeb is specific to Odoo</li>
<li>QWeb provides a small selection of standard UI widgets</li>
<li>Odoo documentation sucks and the QWeb part of it is no exception</li>
<li>Reactive design with QWeb still sucks and is still buggy</li>
<li>QWeb is only targeted for browsers and for converting HTML to PDF</li>
<li>Community support is tiny compared to the Vue community</li>
<li>Lacks support for many modern paradigms and concepts available in Vue</li>
<li>No browser plugins to help QWeb development</li>
<li>No popular IDE plugin support</li>
<li>Odoo Studio requires Enterprise Edition ($$$)</li>
<li>Work done in Odoo Studio can&rsquo;t be exported as .xml view files that can be used in an add-on and stored in a code repo</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to find UX developers that know QWeb or are willing to learn it and those that do usually cost more ($$$)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conversely, using Quasar/Vue for UX development has specific advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s much easier to learn and use</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s much simpler to find Vue developers than QWeb developers</li>
<li>It has a huge, vibrant and active community</li>
<li>Lots of great documentation and video tutorials</li>
<li>Quasar apps can be built to target browsers, mobile devices or cross platform desktop as Electron apps</li>
<li>Quasar provides rich selection of UI widgets</li>
<li>All the major IDEs have plugins to make Vue development even simpler</li>
<li>Quasar apps look slick and modern compared to QWeb forms</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools">Vue Dev Tools</a> plugin is available for all major browsers</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="on-the-flip-side">On the flip side</h4>
<p>What does QWeb have that&rsquo;s better than Quasar? Currently, Odoo has a great calendar with drag and drop support for
moving appointments. The QCalendar component from Quasar supports it also .. but .. I just haven&rsquo;t prototyped it yet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="odoo-concepts-for-this-project">Odoo concepts for this project</h2>
<p>As you can see in the main <a href="/doc/development">Odoo Development</a> page, the Odoo setup for this project centers around
usage of the Odoo Projects module and additional modules that extend that. There is a lot more to Odoo than the Projects
module, but the main concepts I want to demonstrate is how to build a Vue app that uses Odoo in the backend. For this
the Projects module is enough to demonstrate all the paradigms involved in using Odoo&rsquo;s JSON-RPC API, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>authenticating against Odoo and getting user profile data</li>
<li>reading data from Odoo including schema info for fields</li>
<li>creating / updating records</li>
<li>archiving / deleting records</li>
<li>calling actions on modules</li>
<li>automatic field generation based on Odoo model/field data</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="regarding-the-calendar">Regarding the Calendar</h5>
<p>Odoo does have a Calendar module but its not used for the purposes of this project. Instead we show project task data on
the QCalendar component because project tasks have deadlines, which is fine for basically demonstrating how we can put
that on QCalendar.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="vue-concepts-for-this-project">Vue concepts for this project</h2>
<p>In the Vue/Quasar sub-project in the <code>/ui</code> directory, I provide components; mixins and a store that bridges the knowledge
gap between Odoo and Vue/Quasar. The idea is that the UI developer can use these to easily create lists and forms that
connect to Odoo in the back-end, with minimal effort and just basic knowledge of Odoo. The UI developer should only need
minimal attentiveness concerning schema&rsquo;s of the various Odoo models because that information is already stored in Odoo
and the Odoo resources here already account for all of that. The UI developer should only need to focus on what fields
the end user needs; if they should be represented in specific &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; and how they should be laid out.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are an Odoo developer and not a Vue developer, you should find it very easy to adapt because I keep
some familiar Odoo paradigms. For example field declarations used in forms are exactly the same. For example the
following snippet defines a field, as its used in Odoo and as its used in Odoo-In-Vue: <code>&lt;field name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>Also, I follow the exact same paradigm for specifying widgets for fields. For example, in Odoo, time fields are stored
as a <code>float</code> value, but to show that properly in an Odoo form, you must use the following in the Odoo form XML to get
the <a href="https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/forum/aide-1/question/time-field-in-odoo-124037">proper type of input field</a> (&ldquo;widget&rdquo;):
<code>&lt;field name=&quot;time&quot; widget=&quot;float_time&quot;/&gt;</code> and in Odoo-In-Vue, its exactly the same.</p>
<p>Functionality for reading, writing, creating, archiving and deleting records is handled for you by the Odoo web client
and so, in the Vue project, I handle it for you as as well. This way you just concentrate on defining forms.</p>
<p>Odoo automatically checks permissions on models and Odoo-In-Vue does that in the OdooBaseData component.</p>
<p>I still have a lot more work to do, but this should give you an idea that things that Odoo does for you, this project
will do for you as well, and that way you can just focus on designing forms, lists and layouts and not how to make
everything work with Odoo.</p>
<h5 id="where-the-paradigms-deviate">Where the paradigms deviate</h5>
<p>There are obviously major differences between Odoo QWeb and Vue and I am not going to list them all, but instead this is
a very short list of some ways that a make big deviations from Odoo&rsquo;s approach to the client UI architecture, regardless
of the Qweb and Vue differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>When rendering a form, I don&rsquo;t read all the fields for the record from Odoo but instead, I only read the fields you
specify. This keeps your async communication with Odoo very lean and fast. Odoo will pull everything, even if your form
never uses all fields.</li>
<li>I cache very specific schema data in the browser based on only on how your forms and lists are defined.</li>
<li>I use Vue <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">single file components</a> so that you can keep all
component related logic in one logical file, although, this is not required. In Odoo, you are forced to spread out the
XML, JavaScript and CSS.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="doesnt-owl-solve-everything">Doesn&rsquo;t OWL solve everything?</h4>
<p>For some people, it might. On the other hand I still come across many people that still believe there isn&rsquo;t a need for
yet another web framework. Also, OWL, still has many of the same problems as QWeb does.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortage of 3rd party components, IDE support, browser plugins and frameworks compared to Vue</li>
<li>no native mobile support</li>
<li>not compatible with earlier versions of Odoo</li>
<li>Odoo specific</li>
<li>does not support all the proven paradigms of existing frameworks such as Vue and React</li>
<li>poor documentation</li>
<li>immature project</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt OWL is a huge and over-due leap in the right direction compared to QWeb, but the fact that the Odoo corporate
machine does not want it to be back ported shows their intent to keep customers on a forced upgrade treadmill - which in
my opinion is one of the most counter productive aspects of the platform.</p>
<p>In fact, I suspect that once they have people accepting it, they will probably make it an EE only feature.</p>
