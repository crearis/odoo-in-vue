      <description>Odoo Concepts As you can see in the main Odoo Development page, the Odoo setup for this project centers around usage of the Odoo Projects module and additional modules that extend that. There is a lot more to Odoo than the Projects module, but the main concepts I want to demonstrate is how to build a Vue app that uses Odoo in the backend. For this the Projects module is enough to demonstrate all the paradigms involved in using Odoo&amp;rsquo;s JSON-RPC API, which are:</description>

      <description>Starting backend services in Docker The scripts in the /docker dir are only for getting the backend services running. Docker is not used to run the Quasar/Vue part of the project. Quasar provides a built-in server for running the Vue app. There is a script in /docker which provides a proxy server that will reverse proxy to Quasar&amp;rsquo;s built in server, but obviously for that to work, the Quasar server needs to be started from the commmand line (e.</description>

      <description>About the Quasar/Vue project Using VueJS with Odoo is an established paradigm that we borrow from older projects in the public domain. The Quasar/Vue app in this project is obviously not meant to be complete since its just a functional sample that demonstrates how to use VueJS with Odoo as the backend.
