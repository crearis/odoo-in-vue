# Project Directories and Files

All of the core Odoo files in the Vue project which provide Odoo specific functions and features, have their file name
prefixed with `Odoo`. These files are explained as follows:

**Components:**

- `/vue/src/components/odoo/OdooBaseData.js`: Provides core data features for other Odoo components
- `/vue/src/components/odoo/OdooBaseForm.js`: Base form component to extend to create your own Quasar/Odoo forms
- `/vue/src/components/odoo/OdooField.vue`: Provides field for your Quasar/Odoo form based on field schema data
- `/vue/src/components/odoo/OdooForms.vue`: Provides a standard container for your Quasar/Odoo forms with standard buttons

**Mixins:**

- `/vue/src/mixins/Odoo.js`: Mixin for Odoo server interaction
- `/vue/src/mixins/OdooQUtils.js`: Mixin for features that pertain to Quasar and Odoo, e.g. Odoo to Quasar data conversion
- `/vue/src/mixins/OdooRpc.js`: Mixin for RPC calls made to Odoo

**~~Vuex~~ Pinia (Store):**

- `/vue/src/store/odoo.js`: ~~Vuex~~ Pinia file for local Odoo data

Currently, these are all the files you need to create your own Quasar-Odoo project and eventually these will be files put
into an NPM package. The other files of interest are in `/vue/src/components/myforms`, which are example Vue components
that use the files listed above and demonstrate how simple it is to create Quasar-Odoo forms. Lastly, the `/vue/src/pages`
directory can be reviewed to give a broad level example of how one might set up their own Quasar-Odoo project in Vue.
